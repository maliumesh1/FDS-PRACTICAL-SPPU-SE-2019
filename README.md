Group C





Department of Computer Engineering has student's club named 'Pinnacle Club'. Students
of second, third and final year of department can be granted membership on request.

e.g. A ={ a, b, {c, d,e, {}, {f,g}, h, I, {j,k}, l, m}. Store and print as set notation.
Group D


A palindrome is a string of character that‘s the same forward and backward. Typically,
punctuation, capitalization, and spaces are ignored. For example, “Poor Dan is in a
droop” is a palindrome, as can be seen by examining the characters “poor danisina
droop” and observing that they are the same forward and backward. One way to check
for a palindrome is to reverse the characters in the string and then compare with them
the original-in a palindrome, the sequence will be identical. Write C++ program with
functions-
a) To print original string followed by reversed string using stack
b) To check whether given string is palindrome or not
In any language program mostly syntax error occurs due to unbalancing delimiter such as
(),{},[]. Write C++ program using stack to check whether given expression is well
parenthesized or not.


Implement C++ program for expression conversion as infix to postfix and its evaluation
using stack based on given conditions:
1. Operands and operator, both must be single character.
2. Input Postfix expression must be in a desired format.
3. Only '+', '-', '*' and '/ ' operators are expected.


A classic problem that can be solved by backtracking is called the Eight Queens problem,
which comes from the game of chess. The chess board consists of 64 square arranged in
an 8 by 8 grid. The board normally alternates between black and white square, but this is
not relevant for the present problem. The queen can move as far as she wants in any
direction, as long as she follows a straight line, Vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
Write C++ program with recursive function for generating all possible configurations for
4-queen's problem.



Group E


Queues are frequently used in computer programming, and a typical example is the
creation of a job queue by an operating system. If the operating system does not use
priorities, then the jobs are processed in the order they enter the system. Write C++
program for simulating job queue. Write functions to add job and delete job from queue.


Write program to implement a priority queue in C++ using an inorder list to store the
items in the queue. Create a class that includes the data items (which should be
template) and the priority (which should be int). The inorder list should contain these
objects, with operator <= overloaded so that the items with highest priority appear at the
start of the list (which will make it relatively easy to retrieve the highest item.)


A double-ended queue (deque) is a linear list in which additions and deletions may be
made at either end. Obtain a data representation mapping a deque into a one-
dimensional array. Write C++ program to simulate deque with functions to add and
delete elements from either end of the deque.

basis. Order once placed cannot be cancelled. Write C++ program to simulate the system
using circular queue using array
